# Project 4: Around The U.S.

## About:
Project number 4 as part of my attendance of the Practicum by Yandex coding bootcamp.
This time we used Javascript to make a popup window appear and edit text in the profile section.

## Tech used:
I used BEM to structure the files and classes, flexbox and grid to style the elements on the page and pure JS (no libraries) to make the page interactive.
